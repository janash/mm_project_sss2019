# Day 5 - Introduction to C++11

By the end of Day 5, students will learn:

- The difference between compilation and interpretation
- The basics of C++: std input/output, functions, and classes
- How to compile a C++ program with g++/clang
- How to setup and use *conda* to install C++ packages
- How to install and use *Eigen* to perform numerical linear algebra operations

Using Eigen, students will be asked at the end of the day to re-write the methods that calculate the potential energy (`calculate_total_pair_energy` for MM and `calculate_energy_mp2` for QM) in C++ (to be used on Day 6) in C++. 

Should we use cProfile on Day 5?
